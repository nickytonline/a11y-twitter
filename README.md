Small changes to how you use Twitter to promote Tweeting in an accessible manner. For now, it will only prompt once per Tweet to add alt text to an attachment before you Tweet.

Simple but effective. üòé

The extension is available for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers that support the Chrome Web Store. It's coming soon to Firefox. It works, you just need to submit it to the add-on store. üòé

Be sure to test in other Chromium-based browsers and Firefox by following the Install the extension unpacked section of the README.

1. Run `yarn` to install the required dependencies.
1. Run `yarn start` to start the browser extension in development mode. Note that with the v3 manifest for browser extensions, you can no longer do hot module reloading, but instead, the extension will cause a page refresh when the code has changed.
1. Load the browser extension unpacked from the `dist` folder.
